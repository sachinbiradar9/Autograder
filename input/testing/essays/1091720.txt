Young people are energetic and driven, so they have a responsibility to use their talents meaningfully.  It is expected that they be enthusiastic about giving back to the community that raised them. 
But what actions constitute "helping" our community? Voluntary work at non-profit organizations seems to be the easiest answer.  Small acts of kindness - like helping a senior citizen cross the road - are often cited as ways for young people to serve the community. I believe that any work - paid or unpaid - done for the right intentions should count as helping our community.  

Having said that, I think that the amount of time young people nowadays devote to their communities is regrettably lacking. I personally know a few young people who have never done an hour of voluntary work in their lives.  Not only are they uninterested in the welfare of their fellow citizens, neither do they see any point in serving their own family members or friends.  Since they fail to see beyond themselves, there is no hope that they will give any time to help the community at large.  

Most educated young people have a vague sense of responsibility involving their communities, but there are so many distractions that prevent them from devoting time to it. Peer pressure, new technology, the mass media and pop culture simply teach them all to concentrate on themselves and try to live a happy, materialistic life. It is a pity, since so many young people are lead away from exercising their civic responsibility.  No matter how much they are told by parents to help their community, it is impractical if there are so many distractions in their lives. 

Many young people do a small part in helping the community by doing community service. However, performance isn't satisfactory either. Even if they are doing voluntary work for no monetary pay, many young people are inevitably waiting for payment in some other form - points for an academic scheme, an impressive mention in their resume, or an award for "outstanding service". If they are intent on these superficial rewards, what follows is that the extent of their help will not be proportionate. Moreover, what little heart they have for service will diminish quickly, and of course this is definitely not "enough". 

In some situations, it is certainly understandable that young people choose other activities over service. Students should put their studies on high priorities, and young people in general seek excitement and new experiences, so they are entitled to some level of self-centeredness.  In fact, pursuing wild, creative ways of doing things will probably be a help to community, if these young people choose to lend their talents and innovations accordingly. This requires a much deeper understanding than exists in the young people of today, but it also goes to show that the measure of contribution is hardly as simple as time - it involves an awareness and some heart in all of us.
