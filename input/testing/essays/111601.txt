During the last years, we have seen a big difference in the way of life of all people. A lot of events have occured during the 19th, like the world wars, the development of capitalism, the conflicts of religions etc... and all of that have modified our society in France, or in other countries. I will take for my exemple the situation in France. What happened in May 68 have contributed to change people minds. Before this period, young people were more obediant and structured in my opinion. Moreover, I think that they were generally less individualists than today. Capitalism have developped that feeling and the consequences of all that is the fact that young people are obsesed by their individual success because times are more and more difficult and people know that it will be certainly more difficult in the future. So young people are pressured and they are conscient that they have to succeed. They work harder at school or they have two jobs like I can see around me, and they have less time to make anything. To resume, I think there are two principal causes: one because young people are nowadays more individualists and don't think in helping other persons, two because they have less time due to the new social model. However, we can see in a few situations that young people are able to help everyone that is in a difficult situation. For example, during the Tsunami, we have seen a lot of young people giving a gift to La Croix Rouge or other associations. Many of them have expressed the desire to go there to help people who were reached. In fact, we can see that these young people can help their communities when there is an accident. So we can say that it's ponctual and they g can give the best of them at certain moments. But I think too that these type of population don't make enough efforts to help other people who need their help.
