While life can be enjoyed by people in all phases of life, I personally believe that young people enjoy life more.

Main factor in favor of young people is their high energy levels. Young people are full of life and like to experiment different options.  Such experimentation builds their life experiences. Exercising different options provides multiple opportunities to enjoy life.

Younger people have higher physical strength to endure outdoor activities. For example, while a senior citizen may require a detailed planning and preparation before they could take an adventure camping, young people could combine their youth with sense of adventure to take up such a trip with little or no planning.

Young people also have time on their side to take risks. Unlike, older people who are risk averse, young people can take higher risks. Young people realize that in case of any negative consequence, they will have time to repair the damage. This risk friendliness allows young people to stretch their limits and enjoy life to the fullest.

While it is true that young people do not have enough time in their schedules as compared to older people. However to enjoy life, time is not the sole requirement. Young people have multiple outlets to enjoy life - at work, home or socializing. Hence a person need not wait till retirement to enjoy life.

Most of life's enjoyments will require commitment of financial resources also. It is likely that smart older people would have achieved financial success to enjoy life, however it is more probable that young people will have more expendable income to enjoy life.

In conclusion, while life can and should be enjoyed in every phase of life, young ones should capitalize on this opportunity. Young people have all supporting factors in their favor to enjoy life to the fullest.
