I agree with this statement. i feel the student understad ideas and concepts then facts. It is clear the student lern more his ideas and concepts rather then the facts in classrooms. Soi agree with this statement. In generally anysubjects are clasified ind two ways either scince or social. Speciaaly in social subject we lern so many things like histry geography economics and civics i tdiffer what we see to what we lern in histry. suppose few contries histry less then the 500 years but those contries are now word bigest lephacanamis and those rool entair world.

   In starting of twentiath century ther is no development of electronics scince. now we arre not thinking with of eleconics and computer and power but is it is truth. so many things the ideas and concepts very iportent.like a meterials. their chemical bonding conductvitytypes of meterial these are lern from ideas and concepts only not throuth facts.in meterial we have different types of classification fron thier characteristics


  supose now we are disscussed scince class. In this case i would like to discous solour system. insolor system sun is not revolving but we feel sun is moving from east to west in naturally the Earth is moving fron west to east. and i will give another example if we travel any vehicle we feel soroundings are moving we feel we are stationary like that. An other example we feel Earth is like plat it's not like a sphere shape but actually our Earth is sphere shape not flat shape. But generaaly we feel it is a flat shape,, if it is plat shape sun rising times and sun set time must be same but it is not true.i feel above threee example we understand ideas and concept s then theit is for then to lern facts.

    I give one technical example in this case. in general we are not acept energy transfer in real life but energy transfer one form to an other form of energy. but from facts we are disagree we can produce from heat to cold. in our fact life we feel it's very diffuclt. but it produced the heat is (in boiler ) some kinetic energy this kinetic energy converted into electical energy with help of terbine, and finally electrical energy into cold from with help of refregaration process.
So i stangly agree my entair part of discution. "That is more importent to students to understand ideas and concpts then the it is for them to lern facts".
