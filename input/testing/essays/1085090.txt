I definitely agree with the statement  " Successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ". I will explain this opinion as follows.
	The world is in a great stage of transformation. If people still follow to the same old traditional ways and ideas of the past we will not move further in our life. If Graham Bell did not try out for new things where would have been our communication system. If Wright Brothers did not take risk where would have been out transportation system. It all is about thinking differently, creatively to becone successful. 
	According to experiments conducted our mind is very creative. It can think about wide variety of things in wide variety of ways. We must not suppress our thoughts to the traditional ideas our ancestors followed and stick back to the rules and regulations. It may be necessary to follow some rules in some cases. But in all cases it is not. This trying out for new things must be cultivated from the childhood itself. Take for example of a maths problem to be solved. A child must think of finding a new way of finding a solution rather than following the solution given by the teacher. This makes the child to better understand the problem and will never forget about it. This makes the child successful and the success is carried throughout the career. 
	In the initial stages we may be criticized for our ideas but one should not be given up by such critics. We must remember that great people are often criticized. "Even Einstein was questioned". To be successful we need to go on with our ideas and creativity, we need to try out for new things every time, we need to take risk, forget the old traditional ways of doing things but not to care about the criticism. We should challenge the critics. 
	Success involves a lot amount of risk when we are trying out for new things. Nothing can be easlily obtained. We should never be afraid of the amount of the risk invovled but should always head towards the success after the risk. The success involving a risk gives us great pleasure than success without involving risk. " The fruit gained from a great risk is more tasty".
	Its proved in past and also it will be proved thereafter that trying new things, thinking differently and creatively, taking risk brings a great success. In this way i support my statement.
