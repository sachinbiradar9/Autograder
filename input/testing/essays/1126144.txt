Business meaning of advertisement is to show what you are not.So I completely agree with the fact that advertisements tell speak 'bad' products 'good'.Mostly advertisements talk about the bad products.

  Today advertisements are everywhere . Turn on your idiot box , it will show you advertisements mainly with certain gaps which are called programs.You turn on your PC, cross a busy road, or do whatever ; you cannot get rid of an ad.Now comes the business aspect. Why there is need of so many advertisements? Two words have the answer. 'Purchase' and 'profit'. All advertisement are the brainchild of some unsuccessful products which the creator want to make it successful.

     So why one person needs to advertise his product? To make it famous? Yes maybe but the most dominant reason is to sell and to make profit .Why you need an ad if your product is so good? I witnessed the same situation when I was young. I loved one chocolate of a particular brand . I never saw its' advertisement in TV or in any  journal. Now suddenly oneday I saw its ad which told me that it has changed . Joyfully I went to a shop , I bought one, only to discover that price had increased and the cover pack became more glossy.Thats the magic of an ad, when the product is right  you dont need to advertise it . 

   Advertisements are very lucrative because of its 'free' offer . I have seen thousands gather in front of malls to get a free offer with a particular product . So what is the motive of the free offer? Nothings comes for free . Free is the word that is seen by all , we need to see some invisible information such as decrese in quality in place of free. Once my mom bought vegetable oil after seeing a wonderful new ad of the reduced price product . Later she discovered that the expiary date is already over.

  In some cases what an ad tells are completely lie. Our favourite actors and actresses dont bath with that particular soap which they advertise.These are just to promote sell. 

      I mostly got worst products whenever I was prompted by an advertisement , so my suggestion is  ' don't be fooled by any advertisement '.
