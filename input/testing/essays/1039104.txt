Something that we have to have in main are the differents between being a young people or old people. What can you do when your are young rather that old? This question will give you which one is better.
Night live, responsabilities and money are the differents between then.

  We have to begin night live. Some young people between 15 and 20 do not even  what a night live is, so if you are an adult, you can enjoy a night culb without any restrition. Other inportant point is that you do not have to tell anyone where are you or what are you doing because you a old and you do not depend of your fathers.

  Also, other important point in the live of a young or old people is the responsability. If you are young you allways will have school and that is a big responsability, but if you are a old, you just will do whatever you want and you just have to worry about yourself.

  The last and most importan point is the money. when you are young you have you father and they are the only ones who are worry about the economy. however, you will not have everything you want only because is not you money is their money, so if you want to bay something the do not want you just cannot bay it.

  in conclution, the life for the old people was, is and will be allways better and if your are young you can enjoy but not as much as you want. but you can also wait until you grow up and become a old man.
