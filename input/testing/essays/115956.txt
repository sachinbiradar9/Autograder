   The number of cars that are used today mainly depends on to aspects : the number of cars offered by car industry and the number of cars asked by the world population. But as long as selling cars provides remuneration to the car industry, one can presume that the number of cars in circulation in the future will mostly depends on whether it will be interesting to buy a car in, let say, twenty years.

   Quite a number of statements are in favor of a reduction of the world's cars population in the next years.
   First, the fact that a good part of the estimations we have tells us that the Earth oil supplies won't last forever. In fact, with the technologies we are disposing of, we can alledge that fuel won't be at our disposal any more by the year 2050. It will anyway have become pretty expensive. 
   Secondly, global warming being an issue which has to be faced, the world's population will have to dicrease its use of fuel, and thus of cars. Stricter laws will imply less pollution in the future.
   Eventually, the evolution of customs worldwide may occur with the dicrease of the number of cars in the next years. Since people are gathering in bigger and bigger cities, the use of subways and buses will grow.

   But the major point is : if the fact that there will be lesser cars in twenty years is not even certain, what is for sure is that cars will be different. 
   Why could the world's population demand for cars grow ? The first answer is mere : the human population will grow over twenty years for sure. The cars demand being correlated to the world's population, the global demand could be more important in the future. Cars can also use less fuel for the same distance, and new petroleum fields can be discovered.
   But since it will soon be more economical, new supplies of power will be used in the car industry. For example, oil provided by vegetals can be used with success like in Brasil, not to talk of hydrogen energy.

   Eventually, the question of the global evolution of the cars population worldwide is open. I personnally alledge that there will be more cars in the future, but that they will be ;ore respectful of the emnvir
