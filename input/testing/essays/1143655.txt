I strongly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time for helping their communities. 
  On of the reason is that they do not have time to spend time on those things. They must spend most of their time on studying in order to get good grade and go to well-known university.
  Also young people nowadays are not good at comunicating with others and are hestate to meet new people. It occures as people no longer talk with neibour as much as we did before. There is one example in my community. There was an opportunity visiting a house, which were for eldery people to live, in the communities. It was an opportunity only for children but there were only two people attended.The reason why rest didn't come was that they were afraid to meet and talk with new people.
   The other reason is that young people nowadays are not intrested in helping communities. School does not teach how important it is to help the communities and join the activities, they only teach things that the students need for exam. Adult should encourage young people to give more time on helping communities.
