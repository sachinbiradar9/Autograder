Whethere most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is a good question.
The advertisement is made to increase the selling of the product. So, majour are the qualities of the product that the people know, majour are the selling. Then it can be that some advertising make poduct seem much better.
An example are the figure of food products, in the image on the box they seem very beautifull and also very good to eat. But when you open the box and see the product inside, you understand that the pruduct on the box is very different.
When I was child and I saw the advertisement of a play I would had this play because in the advertisement it moved much, spok a lot and it had beautifull color. But when I took the play it was static, spok only four or five word and it had bad color.
In this case the advertising is used to increase the selling unsing the little child that when they see something that looks like beautifull they want that.
There are also some rules that say that the advertisements must respect the quality of the product, but these rules are not always used.
To tell the truth there are also some advertisemets that make seem the products as they realy are. But these are not much because if you show in an advertisement a product that is not beautifull the people prefer to buy another product that in the advertisement seem more beautifull than the other, maybe also if it cost much.
