I DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT BECOUSE , NO BODY SHOULD SUCCESS COUSING FAIL FOR SOME BODY ELS . IF EVERY BODY DO THE SAME THING , THEN , WHERE IS THE HUMINATATION . IF SOME BODY WANT TO DO SOME THING LIKE, MAKING A COMPANY HE SHOULD NOT DO IT BY HIM SELF FOR HIM SELF , NO , HE WILL NEED SOME BODY TO HELP HIM FOR ALL THIS THINGS
