I disagree this idea. 
First, learning the facts is basical thing. If we enter the class which famous teacher making, we can not understand in real meanings. 
Learning the facts makes us wake up. We are students.  We are cheep person.  But we study facts, we can become the perrson who can have real thinkings.
Secondly, understanding is discribing the way of thinking. We act on the basical thinkings. Basical thinkings can be affected by other person's thinkings. Belief is good examples. Person can only think about one way of thinking, he is very danger. 
Japanese students do not know real facts. And they tend not want to know the real facts. They know the facts are hard for themselves. They are runing away. Because teacher should teach facts. We should pay attenntion to recieve facts.
