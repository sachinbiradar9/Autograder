I agree with the fact, that if you want to be successful, you have to take risks sometimes.  I want to stress that it does depend on the individual's situation.
For example, if a creative director of an advertising agency has had lots of success with using one certain method in creating an ad, it is smart to stick with that method.  At some point, as time changes, people's interests change and the creative director needs to consider a differnt method in creating an ad.  If the director won't consider doing so, he might lose his clients.  This is when I would say that it is important to take a risk and do something different with your ad.  
Based on my own experiences I have to say that I had more success with taking risks at times.  For example, I have great passion for the arts and therefore, I have taken quite a few drawing and painting classes in the past.  At some point, one of my teachers graded me down on one of my projects, because apparently I always used the same method in drawing, and I never tried something new.  
This is when I decided to try pastell paint, instead of the good old charcoal.  My teacher was impressed by the color composition, which was a change from just black and white drawings.  My teacher gave me a better grade, not necessarily because the picture was better than my other pictures, but rather because of the fact that I was able to deal with something new, such as pastell.
Trying new things gives you exposure to different perspectives, which makes you a more open person to new things.  If you constantly stick with the same old thing, you show a lack of flexibility.  It also shows that you can only be successful in the same area.  
If you try and practice different things, it gives you the opportunity to show more expertise in different areas.  If you don't take the risk of trying something new, you never know whether you could be more successful or not.
