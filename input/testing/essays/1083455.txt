There are now numerous advertisements in television, magazine or newspaper which describe products they made. Also, they attracts consumers and makes them buy their products by advertising. However, there is a problem with most advertisements. It is that the real products are often worse than products shown in advertisements. Advertisements often fake consumers by hiring famous actors and hiding bad characteristics that involved. 
   With such a famous actor , companies could make a lot of money in advertisements. Suppose that certain company hired Bread Pitt. In that advertisement, Bread Pitt uses a new after- shaving lotion that company has made. Then, consumers think that company's after shaving lotion has great quality because well-known actor use it. In addition, people believe that if they buy that product , they could be like famous actor or they could follow actor's fashion at least. Unfortunately, the products are not that great as people expected. Although well-known actors use it, it does not mean that their products are well-made.
  Obviously, companies often highlight the good characterstics involved in their products but they often hide the bad things in advertisements. There are a lot of reasearch which are done by undergraduate students related to this topic. They finally found that even though companies should inform all characteristics by law, they often make bad characteristics invisible. Companies usually put the negative information under their products so that consumers cannot see it. People often see the highlighted words such as "This product is free from pesticides or This product is the first invention in the whole World,"
  Truly, there are some people who say that making great advertisements is obligatory for companies who want to earn lots of money. However, they went too far. Companies should think the consumers' right. They have their rights to buy what they want and based on information that adverstisements gave.
