The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one. Some people find it to be beneficial, and more informative while others think that traveling on their own is more challenging.
I , however believe that traveling with a group guide is better. The reasons for my belief are the following:

First, traveling with a tour guide is more informative, since the guide has all the information about the place, and should be able to answer any question. He has also visited the place many times, and knows all the interesting places to be seen. I think that a person traveling with a tour guide will gain much more inforamtion and knowledge about a country's culture, than if he was to travel by himself. I have travelled with a tour guide once to Turkey, and although it was a tiring trip because the schedule was full, I got to know most of the turkish culture. One of the things I won't forget, is when we visited a play about the old traditional turkish wedding. It was a very interesting thing to see.

Second, the tour guide usually has a schedule for his group. In this schedule the group gets to see the most important, famous, and interesting places in the country being visited, probably a person visiting the country on his own would not have been aware of, or could not have planned such a schedule.  I find the time schedule to be my ultimate reason to choose a tour guide. Another reason, is the financial reason, usually tour guides have special deals with hotels or resturants since they bring them customers.

Third, I believe that traveling with a tour guide who knows the country, and traveling with a group of people is much safer than traveling alone. When visiting a new place, a person does not know the safe places, or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood. These details, which are of great importance, are taken care of by the tour guide.

For all of the reasons, I mentioned above I believe that it is a much safer, and more interesting experience to travel with a tour guide, if of course traveling to a country for the first time.
