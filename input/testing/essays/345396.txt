    "In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today", this what some people said. and there are anothers say the oppist.

    Some of people said that, and they confidance because they have alot of reason. Firstlly, they say that because in the fuater the people will use the modern vichles, but it is not like a car, but like a small plane.Secondlly, in the fuater make alot of train station, and this will replace the cars.


   In another hand, they are who say in the fuater the cars will be increase. have a opinion and it is because in the fuater came alot of torrism and that will make problem in the street. 


And my opinion it is like the people who say "this statment not correct", because by the time the people increase. and this statment impposible. and now we see alot of cars around us. what about after twenty years.
