Different approaches in education discuss wether it is more important for the students to learn about facts or to understand ideas. If one has to choose between both of them, I would say it is more important to learn to understand ideas. I will first present some arguments to support this point, emphasizing on the intellectual importance of the ideas. Then, I will try to explain how complementary are these points and why they are necessary to any good student.
As a student myself, I feel very concerned by this topic, especially because I am a young researcher and the relationship between concepts and facts is critical. However, mainly because facts can be learn outside the school I would agree to state it is more important to understand concepts. For instance, in my own research about the gentrification of Harlem, I am less interested by the facts and the details than by understand the whole process and the trends which drive it. It is true it is very important to understand the concepts of class, place and territory (their role, symbols etc). I think it the role of the school to learn to the students to think by themselves and it succeed giving them the intellectual and conceptual keys and tools to understand a problem, and solve it.
However, saying the concept is more important than the fact (as it implied in the question) I face a big ethic problem. In effect, how can you understand a concept or an idea if you don't know some facts to contextualize it for example. Even if facts can be learned differently than in an academic way, they are required. For example, if I don't know how many people are displaced by the gentrification or in what extent the rents rised due to the gentrification, how can I expect to understand the nature of the transformations occuring in the neighborhood? I think concepts and facts are linked and the reciprocity of their relation is the secret of a good understanding of concepts and ideas.
To conclude, I would say that theorically understand concepts is more important but it only can work with very abstract object of study. The reality is more complex and to understand efficiently an idea, you need to know the context and the facts.
