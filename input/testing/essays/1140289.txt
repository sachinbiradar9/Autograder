I am agree with the statement that says that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts.
Infact, I am a student and for me is essencial for learning well facts, first at all try to understand the ideas and the concepts that there are beside the fact that I must learn.
If a person does not understand the why of the facts I think that is not usefull learn about it.
In my experiance, I always try to understand the reason that there is beside an event. Becouse I think that if I understand the basic concept it will be more simple learn fact and not forget it.
I study criminology and for my work is basic understand why is happen a certain event, what is the principle cause that causes a certain type of event.
For example, for me is not important learn the fact becouse I must understand the reason that ther is beside a certain type of behaviour and not only the result of it.
For my type of study is not important learn the fact but the reason.
But I think that is not usefull only for my type of study but for all type of faculty. For example, in the scientific faculty is also very important it. It will be very important understand the reason why happening a certain natural event for example and not learn the events alone.
In conclusion, I think that if a person want understand very well facts and not learn it becouse of the school or becouse a person says that He must learn it, he must question himself the basic ideas and the concepts that is linked on that events. Also if, for example, the event that he must learn is not a good event, and he must try to do in a different way.
