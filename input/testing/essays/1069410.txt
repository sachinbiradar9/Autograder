I do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people. What makes a young person happy may not make an older preson happy. To "enjoy life"  is a very subjective concept that varies according to the age, cultural background, religious beliefs, social environment and many other factors. Form my own experience, I learn to enjoy life every day.

	When I was a child I was completely unable to socialize, to relate to other children and have fun with my friends. Family problems that I was going through made me a very shy girl. In  many occassions  I could not find the way out from unconfortable situations. The inablity to ask for help made my childhood pretty sad.

	Young people today have, sometimes, problems to express what makes them happy because of "peer pressure". Most of the teenagers who are "followers" (meaning not leaders) may find themselves in awfull situations, doing and performing acts they don't want to do. As we grow up, we  dare to be deffierent. We learn to say "no" and do not feel bad about it. Our personalities get stronger and we feel more comfortables with who we are. 

	As we grow up we learn to overcome obstacles and as we get older we get wiser and learn from our own experiences and other's experiences. The more we know about ourselves, the easier we find our way to happines. It takes time to discover and understand what makes us happy. That wisdom to understand and comprehend what joy means to us comes with age, with a life full experiences, mistakes and successes.

	I strongly believe the opposite of that statement. A shy girl who does not know how  to ask for help, or a teenager who feels oppressed by his or her peers and a life with no experience will certainly have a harder time to find happiness, to enjoy life. As I get older, I get wiser. When I make a mistake I learn from it.  I heard a long time ago that growing older is mandatory, growing up is optional. I agree with that.
