I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. For example, one of my classmates, Anna Bron is very successful in my Advanced Placement in Art 12 class by trying new things.
	Anna Bron is a well known to be a good painter in my school. She said she felt most comfortable with painting and she liked to challenge herself by doing hard things. She has been successful by challenge herself. However, what brought her to the most successful stage was challenge herself by doing easy things.
	There is a project called "Concentration" that all of AP Art12 students have to do. Anna choose to use teabags to symbolize memory of our lives. She believed that used teabags have a memory to each people depends on why that person drank that tea, when they drank it, where they drank it. Her first idea was to make a canvas out of those teabags and paint on it. As I mentioned before, she feels most comfortable with paiting.
	Her subject matter was very interesting, but her idea of paint on it bothered my art teacher. My teacher suggested her not to paint on it but find a way to make it interesting by using teabag itself. Anna said, "but.. that is going to be too easy." She thought making some art project in easy way will result low quality work. No drawing or paining was a big challge for Anna. However, she decided to take my teacher's advise.
	Anna tried new things by make it simple and by using teabag itself. Once she told me that it is so hard to do something so simple and she is not used to it. Later, she found her way to make those teabags seem interesting. She laid out those teabags and made a mobile; quilted with different kinds of teagbags; and other different experimentation. Anna is now making dress out of her teabags that she collected from people and she is acheiving very high stage as an artist. She is not only recieving a high mark in AP Art 12 class but also having the opportunity to try new things. She is successful by experimenting new things.
