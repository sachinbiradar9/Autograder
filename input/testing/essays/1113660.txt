Traffic issues are certainly a huge problem in our current world. A distance of ten kilometers would usually take about ten minutes to cross twenty years ago; however, nowadays that same distance would take about fourty minutes to cross. People are beginning to wonder if a person walked a certain distance, or drove in a car, does the walking individual reach the designated point faster? Such issues are becoming a serious concern to our world. Yet every problem must have a solution, and earth has a trait that when a human creates a problem, eventually he will find a solution. Yet that solution, would cause another problem.

	I personally agree with the statement since already certain protocols are being done in order to deal with such a problem. Mass transit has be extremely subsidized and an incentive to carpool is being stressed upon. Subway rails, trains, and monorails are being created inorder to draw away all the individuals found on the roads. In twenty years their will be definatly fewer cars than what is present today, since individuals would no longer depend on a biast form of transport.Certain cities in our world today can prove how mass transit is an effective way of reducing the number of cars.

	London, England is a perfect example to be used as a city who uses all its transportation methods and incentives to the max. A person who lives in London does not necesarilly need to be stuck in rush hour when he is tired from work and just wants to go home. Such an individual can just enter the tube station and ride the subway to the nearest station to his residence. This type of transportation when people began to adapt to it greatly affected the roads of London, as year by year the streets began to clear up. Countries would probably follow the footsteps of London in the near future.

	Tokyo, Japan is another example of a country that enforces mass transit; however poorly exectued. Underground stations are present within the city, yet the transit system does not support such a mass amount of individuals. Such a situation might solve the problem of fewer cars on the road, but it causes the problem of more people crowded at underground stations.

	The examples presented support the theory behind this argument, which is yes their will be fewer cars in twenty years than their is today; however, that does not solve the main problem. Cars on their own do not cause a crowding effect, people driving the cars cause the crowding effect. When mass transits are used efficiently, than that certain amount of individuals will be evenly distributed among different routes of transport. Yet if mass transit is provoked, than that mass of individuals would just yield to another route, transfering the same problem from point A to point B. Fewer cars will be present in twenty years, but its up to each individual country to distribute the main problem.
