in my opinion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subejcts by number of reasons.  first, to know about many kind of things be great influences for the future.  when you get job, you will not do same kind of work for whole life.  my father is priest and keeps a kindergarden.  he knoews about children because his major was teaching in his college.  after he left grduated the college, he went to another college and studyed about religion.  he talks to so many people and has good activities and hobbys. second, you will be able to make good relationships with other people.  there are so many people around you and everyone is different and have defferent interests.  if you have only limited knowledge and if a conversation is not about the subject you know,  the conversation may be boring for each other.  finally, if you specialize in one specific subject, you will know about the subject very well.  but so many things will be limited such as job, relationships.  i think it is not interesting to live.
