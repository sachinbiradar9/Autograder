Many people would be propose that students are understanded ideas and concepts more siginificant than they are learned the facts. I can hardly agree with. The students learn facts are more beneficial for them.
 
First of all,  text raraly measures a student's social ability, a student's ability to communicate, and a student's ability to successiful  integrate into the world. In contrast, If students are learnd facts ,they can have these qualities more easily.

Besides, if the students are going to successful in today's society, only understand the ideas and concepts is not enough. They learn facts lead to them to become a successful person. For example, it is rare that one finds stimulating employment that does not requir at least a basic on computer. If student is learned the skill of computer, they will be more well-liked.

Last but not least, Learning the facts allows the students become well-developed adluts. If the students only understand the ideas and concepts, they will be a mean-spirited person.

In conclusion, from my perspective, learning facts is more momentous than understanding ideas and concepts.
