I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Eventhough organized tours are usually cheaper and more convenient, I think traveling by your own is a richer experience for several reasons.
The first reason of my belief is that organized tours bring you to the most touristic sites. These places are over-crowded by other tourists, and as a matter of fact, attracts also many local merchants that sell small commodities at expensive prices on all your way. For example, in my trip to China, the tour guide showed us a part of the Great Wall called "Badaling". The place was full of people, I could hardly walk up the wall, it was very unpleasant! On a second trip, I went myself to another point of the Great Wall, which was further to the city than Badaling, but there were much fewer people. Also, the scenery was much more spectacular.
The second reason why I hate organized trips is that you don't have the choice of the timetable. Every visit is precisely scheduled and we should not stay overtime otherwise the bus or tour guide would leave you at the point it dropped you. A visit of the Louvre museum in Paris is not worth if you can only appreciate the "Mona Lisa" painting, and not contemplate the other, less famous, paintings.
Last but not least, I strongly believe that the most interesting part in travelling is when you make contact with the local people. In my trips to foreign countries, I learned a lot through the visit of the country, but I also learned many things about the culture through conversations with locals. It may be disgusting to see Chinese people splitting in the street. But once you understand that they do that to reject bad elements (such as those coming from pollution) instead of keeping them in their body, you may find it smart or at least understandable. Communicating with people, that is how you begin to respect their culture.
To conclude, as per my experience, I always recommend people to make a trip by their own and not with a guide. This is the best way to discover, understand and respect a culture.
