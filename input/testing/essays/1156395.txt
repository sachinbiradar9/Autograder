I totally agree with that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. I have to specific reasons.
First reason is that, It attracts through people's desire and finally, they wants a product and it made peole are going to buy them. Of course, it's most important thing to company as a process of business, they must have need to more profit. So, they should be able to the best to ornate the product in the advertisement. Generally, it has many problems because the following reasons. Almost all advertisement in TV or magazines and so on, to purpose to introduce a product for consummer, but they take only bright side of that. Furthermore,according to those of ads, every product doesn't have any drawback and definitely perfect. However, it's not real and that's because why many advertisements are problem. The biggest problem is that many people who is see the advertisements believe it. It makes people spend their money to buy them. In my case, When I was see a cell After buying that, I realized it doesn't need to me bet it
In this sense, I agree with those of statement.
