The  issue at hand is that it is better to have broad knowedge many academic subgects than to specialize in one specific subgect.
I agee this because people live various world and change quikly.

The first reason that I agree that to have broad knoweage is that it can be prvent for isolation from the peaple. I was a nurse in my contry and need more various knowedge such as english,socialogy, abd culture. To in order to socialate other peole, I need to many academic knowedge. I think that it is important to have various information as well as nusing 

The second reason I believe that I prefer person who have broad knowlede of many academic subgect is that we live various world.
If I know  one thing, I don't understant fileds of others. it causepeople have prejudice the other one.

In conclusion, I content that our society  there is changed so qulicky. We have to learn various thing.
