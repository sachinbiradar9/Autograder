It is a hot topic that successful people are love to try new things and take risks rather than keep to do what they already know how to do well. Manu different people hold the different opinions in the respective angles. In this topic, I need to say I agree that the success is belong to the people who like  the new things and not afraid the risk. There are teo reason to support my idea.

  First, I think the most important quality is finding. The people who like to contact new ways can always  find the solution when they met the problems. In contrast, if you just rely on the tradition way to solve the problem, you are limiting your situation and may not overcome it. In other words, if you are not afraid the proble and face it, you can find it is not a proble for you easily. For example, when I was a child, I need to wait my mon to pick me up and back home after school. One day, my mon can't pick me because my grandmother was sick and she need to go to hosiptal. In that time, there is no mobile phone to be the conatct access. My mon was very nevous that she can not find me. In the mean time, I tried to find something to do and went to the library. In there, I met my brother who was studying and he take me back home finally. 

  Second, another quality is brave. People will sucess because not afraid to try any ways to complish their goal. In gernery, many ways means many chances. That is also measn you are increasing your chances when you are trying the new t


  In conclusion, because of the above reasons, I strongly believed that people who like new things and advantures will be successful easier.
