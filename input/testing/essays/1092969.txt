I do not agree with this statement. Today, technology is advancing with a breathtaking pace. Newer sources of energy are being pursued and more efficient ways of using resources are being researched on continually. The demand for transportation will always remain and people would always like to travel in their own personal space.

The most common fuel that is used for running cars is petroleum and this fuel will be in great scarcity and its demand will keep on increasing as years progress. People have already started switiching to other sources such as hybrid cars which provide a combination of electricity and fuel on which the car can run. Researchers and scientists are continually trying to harness the potential of hydrogen (H) which if successful, can be easily used to reduce any dependence on other fuels because of its abundance on earth.

Governments of various countries are making efforts to make the use of public transport such as public buses and trains more common. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, a huge project is presently under construction for the metro train. Various governments are trying to relieve the dependence of a commuter on cars. But, this does not mean that every single person is going to make use of the train or bus at all times. 

Many people need to travel short or medium distances frequently throughout the day, pertaining to their job requirements. There are also people who do not like travel in public or need to travel in controlled atmospheres because of medical conditions. This category of people will always require that some sort of personal transportation be available which is also comfortable. This requirement can only be fulfilled be a vehicle such as a car. 

Therefore, cars will always be there as a means of transportation and will definitely not decrease in number than what  is present today. Various new sources are being developed and some may also be discovered by scientists and researchers. It is only a matter of time that something more efficient than petrol comes into picture and replace it.
