Some people are saying that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their communities; however, I disagree.  By careful observations, I believe that young people nowadys do give enough time to help their communities.  
 	There are several ways to help the communities such as by volunteering, caring for people, participating in community activities.   	Many young people today make contributions to their communities by participating in volunteering jobs.  A recent news report in Taiwan has shown that more and more students today are willing to volunteer at places including libraries and hospitals, during their summer vacations.  This may seem common in America, however, it's a revolutionary trend in Taiwan.  Ten or twenty years ago, students in Taiwan were regulated by their parents to only focus their attention on their studies.  Young people during that time were educated to only care about themselves, about their studies and were not allowed to do "un-paid" works such as volunteering jobs.  However, during recent years, young people are more willing to sacrafice their time to do volunteering works which shows that young people today spend more time on helping their coummunities.  
	In addition, young people today cares more about people, even animals in their communities.  There was a horrible news about a man who abuse cats in his home recently in Taiwan.  The man force his cats to drink detergents and made them make bubbles.  And then, his took pictures of this abusement and post them on the internet.  The young people in Taiwan were irritated by his actions and by cooperations, track down the man's internet IP address and located where he live.  Consequently, the man was punishment by the police of his actions, due to the help from these young people who cares about animals.  
	Furthermore, many young people particpate in their community activities.  For example, I have a friend that join the dance club that is held by his coummunity.  He was able to meet lots of people with similar interest for that particular club.  And if members from that club has problems, he would try to help them at no costs.  
	Finally, young people today do give time in helping their communities.  And this trend can be easily found by careful observations.
