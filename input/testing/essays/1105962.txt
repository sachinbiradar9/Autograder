My opinion is very simple...i think that is true,young people don't give enough time to helping their communities.
But i think that they aren't totaly guilty of this.
In many case the actions of a person born to the contest when they spent their life...
Family,school,frieds and tv and all of the things that a person do in the first part of his life will influence his personality.
The gift that a young people take to his life coach,are deeply wrong.It's true that people don't help enough their communities ,but is early true that  at the moment there isn't good examples to follow and so will become  everybody best person.
I know that there are many person that are more intersting to help everyone,but for me this person are early a small number.
I'am very intersting for this theme....really!!!
At the moment ,in fact, i work on a call center that help some students of my country that have family problems and thei don't have the possibility to explain their problem to anyone...
For this reason i think that is very,very,very important tell to all the people to do the right thing and begin to help the people that are around we.And the better way is beginning to is't the first of all
