I agree this sentence.Young people every time enjoy life more than older people. 
In my opinion young people very active, make alot of sports,listening music,dancing,singing song,reading going cinema. but older people prefer to aloneto communite other people.
young people doesnt like think life condations,financial problems by contrasting older people.Although young people very powerfull they dont interest any problems for instance;national economy,envoiremental poisionus,starvy. They think every time enjoible things. in addition these young people spend as twice as older people. They dont like mension about their lessons .Where as older people like travellng,resarching events,reading observing events ,listening romantic music.
Conculision being young people is very entertaining thing.young people chance and give to our life movement. if they dont have our life makes us unhappy.world is very active and peacefull them.
