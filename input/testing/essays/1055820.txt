The word advertisement comes from the root 'advert', which means 'to draw attention'. The central motive of all advertisements, is infact to get considerable attention. And the advertisements, generally go beyond simple enumeration of product feautures. They try to make a product look much better than it really is. I totally agree with the statement.

While, advertisements today are much more sophisticated, than they were a few decades ago, the chief theme of an advertisement was always to get more public attention, so that the products could sell better. Initally in 70s or 80s, only the features of a product and customer testimonials were greatly exaggerated. This made a product look much better, than it really was. Inflated customer testimonials helped create a sense of a happy consumer. While, such techniques were already creating a sense of false product perception, it is only in past 1 or 2 decades, has the advertising become so complex and sophisticated. People, children and adults are beguiled by the aura 'modern advertisement' creates about a product. This aura is better known as 'The Brand' among the marketing and advertising firms.

These modern advertisements basically create implicit associations of certain product types with certain behaviors, in the consumer minds. Associations like - if you drive 'Car Z8' you are cool. Or if you use certain perfumes, you will be much more attractive to the opposite sex. These associations create illusions in front of consumers, hence ensuring that they can not make rational and logical choices about products. Moreover, with such advertising it is no longer necessary for a product to be good, in order to be commercially successful. A regular garment line with similar designs, could command twice the price with a celebrity endorsement. Such, techniques ensure that consumers and the manufacturing companies ignore what is really important - the product, and not it's aura.

Also, this false image, contributes to what is called the mad consumerism. People getting insane to get certain is not good for society. With advertisements and branding people are sometimes unable to seperate wheat from the chaff. What is really important and what is just a fake.

I strongly believe, the advertisements make a product look much better using various methods. However, such marketing does harm to the society in general, and consumers in particular.
