	The pesipicuous phrase, "On the move" has probably been termed after much thought. Research shows that since the dawn of civilisation, man has been a tourist in a crude sense. This is evident in the study of nomads, shifting agriculture and the like. However, my purpose to highlight this fact is not to discuss history but to merely initiate the debate whether there'll be fewer cars in the coming twenty years or not. In my opinion, the number of cars produced in the future will be on the rise rather than passing a declination. I would like to support my stand with the following reasons.
	The automative industry has witnessed a manifold increase since man has invented the wheel. So, to believe that this rise will ever decline, is highly unlikely and improbable. Firstly, economic reviews show that living conditions will improve in the future which means people have greater leisure time. That goes out to suggest that people will have more time to spend with their families and go out on vacations and using cars people can drive to farther destinations.
	Even if the thought is inclinated to the rich, there is another reason to believe why car production will increase. There has always been a focus on science and technology improving the nature of things and cars are not an exception. Infact, lot of investment is going into making solar cars and better fuel efficient cars. Certainly, the expenditure being done on the research is not to never make use of it in the future. This suggests that people want to have more cars in the future.
	Lastly, necessity is being combined with luxury in the economic arena as of today. When people have a proportionate rise in income, they use less of public utility services. Taking the middle income group as an example, I would like to illustrate that an increase in income always shifts people's preferences to personalise commodities. One would definitely want to own something when one has the money to do so and with the economic development throughout the world, people would like to switch to owning their own cars than using the public transport system.
	Therefore, I believe that indeed there will be more cars in the years to come.
