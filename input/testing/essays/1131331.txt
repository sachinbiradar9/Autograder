I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is with a tour guide.

Most of the people would not agree with this statement, as they will argue that you can become an explorer if you travel without a tour guide. Well, this can be true if you are travelling alone, travelling with a lot of time on your hands and travelling within your own country.

But imagine if you were to visit a foriegn land, where you do not know any one. You do not know the people, the customs and the traditions. You do not know the historic places and you do not know the directions. How can you enjoy a tour in which you spend most of your time figuring out where to go and how to get there?

Travelling in a group led by a tour guide has many other benifits, such as meeting the people in your group who share the same interest as yours. You can communicate with them and exchange a lot of valuable information. You can know where they come from and perhaps they can become your tour guides in their country and you can do the same for them. 

Tour guides know the exact history of a particular place. They can take you to places which you might not have an access to if you were travelling on your own. Tour guides can also give you hints and tips when it comes to dealing with the locals. They can advice you of the places that you should and should not go. 

Most of all, the tour guides give you the best return on your investment. You can go to a foriegn country and make the best use of your time by not missing any of the famous and important places that you could've missed if you were to travel alone.
