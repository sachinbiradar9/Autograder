Some people disagree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. However, I agree with the statement for the following reasons.

First of all, a famous person who advertises products may make us misunderstand the products. For example, I bought a new car three years ago. Because a new car was very high for me, I searched a lot of cars by using internet and talking with salespeople. This searching process continued for about five months. However, the most important factor to buy my car was the T.V. commercial that Ichiro, who was the most famous baseball player in Japan, advertised the car. I loved him very much and if I bought the car, I would feel to be close to him. However, this decision resulted in failure since this car had a lot of problems. If Ichiro had not advertised this car, I would not have bought it. This experience definitely demonstrates that a famous person who advertise products may  make us misunderstand the products.

Additionally, advertisements often emphasize on only merits of prodctus. For example, I bought a new computer last year. Because his computer was advertised as the cheapest and latest machine, I decided to buy it very quickly. However, I found that the most of the softwares, such as "word" and "excel", were not incorporated in it. Generally speaking, familiar softwares are incorporated in a computer in Japan. However, this advertisement did not express this weak point. If had have all of the information about the computer, I would not have bought it. This example clearly explains that advertisements often emphasize on only good points of products.

In conclusion, I definitely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
