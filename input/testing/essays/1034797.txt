Like wars and foreign policy also a big part of our future depends on oil and fossil-resources.There are two possibilities in my opinion. The first one is that there will definitelty be fewer cars in use than today. Because there might not be enough oil to provide fuel for the millions of cars. But one has to considers that the consequence is that not only cars are affected. One could easily say that a car is not that important. But if there is no fuel left for the cars, there is either non for the bus, for a taxi, for the loanmower and for airplanes. Nobody will go nowhere. I personally could take my bike and go to the grocery store, but what for? There will be no possibility to do my groceries because the shelves will be empty. If there is no fuel for cars, then there is no fuel for trucks that take the groceries to the supermarket. And this is only the peak of the iceberg. There will be no production, no traffic and even todays hightech might break down. 
I do not want to paint this vision of the future too black. There is another possibility. Since we know that the whole traffic and one could even say the world is too dependant on fossil resouces such as oil, we could change that. There so many sophisticated scientists who work on solutions on how to gain energy. And they have results, like wind and sun als renewable enery resouces. We could already reduce the need for oil, if we for examlpe buz our vegetables from a farmer in our town. Then less truck would be needed. Whatever we do we need to start changing our energy-wasting habits now. Then in twenty years there might be as many cars as today but they will run with non-fossil energy. But  I do definitely think that there will be less cars that run by fuel in twenty years.
