I agree with the statement. 

I think that facts show that most successfull people have tried new things and taken more risks that unsuccessful peolple. For example, most of big computer corporations are owned or managed by people that took many risks in the 1970s and 1980s by betting in the new emerging computer products. Those people took many risks and succeded.

Such reality is in accordance with the economic principle that "more risk involves more gain". Therefore, it is probable that a person who takes risks will have more profits that a person that only does what he knows best. This is under the assumption that the person who takes such risks is a well educated person and not just a gambler.

Also, if a person only does what he already knows how to do best, it will not gain more experience and the knowledge that it will require in order to be successful. For example, if a person only does what he already knows how to do best it will probably never fail. This may seem something good but it is not. It is very important to fail in order to learn from our mistakes. That is why successful persons have often failed numerous times. For example, many of today's rich people have been declared in bankrupcy many times.

Finally, the results of trying something new is most of the times a new product, which, after having the corresponding trademark rights declared, gives a person the exclusive right to sell it. For example, most successful farmaceuticals have became such due to the invention of new drugs. This could only be achieved because such farmaceuticals took many risk and did things in a different way. It is important to mention that this does not only apply to proffesionals but also to artists. Many artists have been successful because they have performed its art in a different way, taken many risks.
