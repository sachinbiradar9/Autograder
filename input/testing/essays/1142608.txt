I am disagree with the statement because I think that the older people enjoy life more than young people.
In fact I think that today a young people have every thing that he or she wants and therefore doesn't fight to conquest his dream or his desire. Therefore after a bit time the young people is tired, because he knows that he can have everything.
In opposite, an older people knows how to fight for conquest his dreams because in the last time there are less things.
In addition today there are more and more problems in opposite the last time, because the society is become more industrialized and the people are always quickly.
This troubles causes a generally unhappy and the young people doens't enjoy his life. 
Therefore I think that today when a young people says that he is happy, it isn't true, but there is a way to hide a generally unhappy.
