Young people seems to be more activ and to spend more time to enjoy life than older people.Indeed it seems that young people want to enjoy the present before getting old. But we can wonder if young people really enjoy life more than older people do. In a first part we will examine qrguments in favour of this statement. Then we will interest in the older people in order to conclude on that statement.

Why is it thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do. The first reason is that young people are more activ. They are more dynamic. They have no fear because they are young. They feel invicible. They are in a period of their life where they have dreams and are ready to do anything to realise those dreams. It can be travelling around the world or doing a special carrer... An other caracteristic of young people is that they have more free time that they can spend with their friends or doing their hobbies. Because they are young they have less restrictions...
It is the reason why they can do what they like. They always find time to do it because they are dynamic.
An other reason why they enjoy life is that they discover life since they are young. A lot of things are totally new for them.
Finally, people meet their best friends as they are young.

Now, why is it thought that older people enjoy life less than younger people ? The first reason is that older people have a lot of obligations such as a job, a family, children... All those things take a lot of time and became sometimes fastidious.

But the matter is to define what does 'enjoy life' mean.
In my opinion, young people enjoy the present instead older people enjoy on a long time
