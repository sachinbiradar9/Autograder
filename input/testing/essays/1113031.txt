 Altough some educators who works in the field of education beleiving learning facts is realy important for all the students, most other educators claim that understanding the ideas and concepts will be useful in their life. 

according to me, most of the emotional facts are subjective. if you learn the other peoples ideas, you can find the best way and you can evolve your own idea. it makes you a self confidence person.  

self confidence people can keep up with rapid social and technological changes. accordin to the conducted from some scientist published in a education issue two mounts ago about % 65 people content with their life. This cocequence indicated us self-confidence people are more succesful and happy in their life.      
Most of the students can forget their knowledge in the long time, but if you understand the texture of the information you can producing some new ideas and comparing the others. 

througout of my life ? was very luck to have a good ralationship with my teachers and coworkers because above the mentioned, ? always to be a invastigater person. it makes me a person who have own ideas.
