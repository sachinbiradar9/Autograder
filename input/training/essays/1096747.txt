	I disagree with this idea. in order to make a huge success, people do not need to create new ways every time when they discover problems. by doing that, they are easily lost their trail and are in danger of new tisks. historically, the methods and discovery ended up with great success, most of them are based on old and traditional ideas. For example, Tomas Edison invited the tellphone as the same time an other scientists did, and he could not become the inviter of the tellphone because he turn out his work three hours leter than the other scientists. HOwever, he advanse his tellphone and solve the many problems the tell phone had.
