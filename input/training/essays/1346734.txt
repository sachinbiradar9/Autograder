I mean they show their item pretier or say something that's not true about it.
I  think  that's abuzing on costumers  trust.
Example : when you are usig a phone card  the time remaining is generaly less than they said.
Another example is car; the preformance they said about it is false.
So as costumer i agee with the statement, and i think people should   take time to make a right choice before buying their items.
And campanies should show the right side of their productions.
